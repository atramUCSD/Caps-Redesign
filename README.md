# My first attempt at redesigning a website

## Things to note

- First attempt at using Express, Handlebars, GET/POST, etc.
- This webpage is not Mobile app friendly. More recent webpages and prototypes I've created have correct media queries. 
- This project underwent a complete UX Research and UI design process. You can view the case study and wireframes at the portfolio section of my website named "CAPS Redesign"
